* Which SVD is faster?
* Check MAGMA website about QRMatrix GPU interface: http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/forum/viewforum.php?f=2

* Change all size_t to int
* Update tensor_all.h
* Check input about Tensor_core, output about Tensor_hao
* Check about continuous memory for all code!!! (other libraries)
* Check test <<endl; vs. "\n"
