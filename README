tensor_lib_hao
==============

The c++ tensor library, it supports many dimension array and uses lapack blas libaray.

Note to myself for developing or updating the library.
1. If we want to pass any "const Tensor_hao&", it is better to pass "const Tensor_core&", then this argument can be "const Tensor_hao_ref&"
2. If we want to pass any "Tensor_hao&&", do not use "Tensor_core&&"! Tensor_hao_ref does not own the memory.
