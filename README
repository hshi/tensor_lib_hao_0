* Which SVD is faster?
* Add cout function
* Check the real time
* Change all thing in header to same namespace
* Add timing for SVD 
* Delete overloads in magma
* Test magma results with cpu results, important!!!
* Test magma in 2d_common.h

* Test lapacke/cblas, mkl, and acml
* Change all size_t to int
* Update tensor_all.h
* Update magma part, make it optional in CMAKELIST.TXT, IF FOUND THEN COMPILE THE PART
* Check input about Tensor_core, output about Tensor_hao
* Check about continuous memory for all code!!! (other libraries)
* Check test <<endl; vs. "\n"
